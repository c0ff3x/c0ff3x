## If you're here that means you reached some of my *ugly* projects, HI ðŸ‘‹

You can refer to me like **c0ffex**, I'm learning whatever related to AI and all their related fields...

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some projects that I'm no so proud of, many of my projects that **were** listed here does not have any good practices at all, and that's because many of my projects are some kind of experiment, if I *feel* a project has reached a "stable version", I will make it public on the profile below. 

Currently all my projects has at the top a legend pointing to this README and that's because I moving to a new host for my projects, if you want to know what projects I'm working on check out my profile on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/c0ff3x). 

In my new profile you can ask me anything ðŸ’¬ and contact me if you want.
